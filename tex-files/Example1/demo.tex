    This  insurance  also  covers  loss  of  or  damage  to  the  vessel  named  herein  caused  by  explosion  on  shipboard  or elsewhere.
     

\noindent This insurance also covers loss of or damage to the vessel named herein directly caused by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Accidents in loading, discharging or handling cargo, or in bunkering;
    \item Accidents  in  going  on  or  off,  or  while  on  drydocks,  graving  docks,  ways,  marine  railways,  gridirons  or pontoons;

    \item Contact with aircraft, rockets or similar missiles, or with any land conveyance;
    \item Negligence   of   charterers   and/or   repairers,   provided   such   charterers   and/or   repairers   are   not   assured(s) hereunder; provided  such  loss  or  damage  has  not  resulted  from  want  of  due  diligence  by  the  assured,  the  owners  or  managers
    of the vessel, or any of them.
\end{itemize}
provided  such  loss  or  damage  has  not  resulted  from  want  of  due  diligence  by  the  assured,  the  owners  or  managers of the vessel, or any of them. \linelabel{line:end-std-terms}

General   average,   salvage and special charges payable as provided in the contract of affreightment, or failing such  provision,  or  there  be  no  contract  of  affreightment,  payable  in  accordance  with  the  laws  and  usages of   the   port   of   New   York.  Provided   always   that   when   an   adjustment   according   to   the   laws   and   usages of the port  of  destination  is  properly  demanded  by  the  owners  of  the  cargo,  general  average  shall  be  paid  in  accordance with same. 

And it is further agreed that if the vessel named herein and/or her tow, if any, shall come into collision with any other  ship  or  vessel  other  than  her  tow,  if  any,  and  the  assured  in  consequence  of  the  vessel  named  herein  being  at fault shall become liable to pay and shall pay by way of damages to any other person or persons any sum or sums in respect  of  such  collision,  this  Company  will  pay  its  proportion  of  such  sum  or  sums  so  paid  as  the  amount  insured hereunder  bears  to  the  agreed  valuation  of  the  vessel  named  herein,  provided  always  that  this  Company's  liability  in respect  of  any  one  such  collision  shall  not  exceed  the  amount  insured  hereunder.  And  in  cases  where  the  liability  of the vessel named herein has been contested or proceedings have been taken to limit liability, with the consent in writing of this Company, this Company will also pay a like proportion of the costs which the assured shall thereby incur, or be compelled to pay; but when both vessels are to blame, then, unless the liability of the owners of one or both such vessels  becomes  limited  by  law,  claims  under  this  Collision  Liability  Clause  shall  be  settled  on  the  principle of  cross liabilities as if the owners of each vessel had been compelled to pay to the owners of the other of such vessels such one-half  or  other  proportion  of  the  latter's  damages  as  may  have  been  properly  allowed  in  ascertaining  the  balance or  sum  payable  by  or  to  the  assured  in  consequence  of  such  collision.  Provided  always  that  this  clause  shall  in  no case  extend  to  any  sum  which  the  assured  may  directly,  indirectly,  or  otherwise  incur  or  become  liable  to  pay  or shall  pay  for:  removal,  destruction  or  abatement  of,  or  any  attempt  or  failure  or  neglect  to  remove,  destroy  or  abate obstructions  or  wrecks  and/or  their  cargoes  or  any  hazard  resulting  therefrom;  loss  of,  or  damage  to,  or  expense, including  demurrage  and/or  loss  of  use  thereof,  in  connection  with  any  fixed  or  movable  object,  property  or  thing of  whatever  nature	(excepting  other  vessels  and  property  thereon);  loss  of  or  damage  to  her  tow;  cargo,  baggage or  engagements  of  the  vessel  named  herein  or  of  her  tow;  or  for  loss  of  life  of,  or  injury  to,  or  illness  of, any person. And provided also that in the event of any claim under this clause being made by anyone other than the owners of the vessel named herein, he shall not be entitled to recover in respect of any liability to which the owners of the vessel as such would not be subject, nor to a greater extent than the owners would be entitled in such event to recover. In  case  of  any  loss  or  misfortune  it  shall  be  lawful  and  necessary  for  the  assured,  their  factors,  servants  and assigns,  to  sue,  labor  and  travel  for,  in  and  about  the  defense,  safeguard  and  recovery  of  the  vessel  named  herein, or  any  part  thereof, without prejudice to this insurance, to the charges whereof this Company will contribute as hereinafter provided.   It   is   agreed   that   the   acts   of   the   assured   or   this   Company,   or   their   agents,   in   recovering, saving  and  preserving  the  property  insured  in  case  of  disaster  shall  not  be  considered  a  waiver  or  an  acceptance of an abandonment, nor as affirming or denying any liability under this policy; but such acts shall be considered as done for the benefit of all concerned, and without prejudice to the rights of either party.

Warranted  that  in  case  of  any  casualty  or  loss  which  may  result  in  a  claim  under  this  policy  the  assured  shall give  this  Company  prompt  notice  thereof  and  reasonable  opportunity  to  be  represented  on  a  survey  of  the  damage, each  party  to  name  a  surveyor,  which  two  surveyors  shall  proceed  to  draw  specifications  as  to  the  extent  of  the damage  and  the  work  required  to  make  the  damage  good.  If  the  two  surveyors  agree,  such  specifications  shall  be binding  on  both  this  Company  and  the  assured,  subject  nevertheless  to  policy  terms  and  conditions  and  the  question of  whether  or  not  the  disaster  and  resulting  loss  or  damage  are  covered  by  this  policy.  In  the  event  the  two  surveyors cannot  agree,  they  must  select  an  umpire,  and  in  the  event  they  cannot  agree  upon  an  umpire,  either  party hereto  may  apply  to  the  United  States  District  Court  for  the  district  in  which  the  home  port  of  the  vessel  named herein  is  located  for  the  appointment  of  an  umpire,  pursuant  to  the  United  States  Arbitration  Act.  The  decision  of the  umpire  so  appointed  shall  have  the  same  force  and  effect  as  the  specifications  aforesaid.  When  specifications have  been  drawn  in  either  of  the  modes  aforesaid,  if  the  Company  shall  be  dissatisfied  with  the  terms  which  the assured  may  obtain  for  the  repair  of  the  damage  as  specified  by  said  survey,  then  this  Company  may  require  the surveyors  or  the  umpire  to  submit  the  specifications  prepared  as  aforesaid  to  such  shipyard,  repair  men,  boat  builders and  shipwrights,  as  may  be  selected  by  such  surveyors  or  the  umpire,  with  a  request  for  bids  for  such  repairs. If  after  reception  of  such  bids,  the  assured  shall  elect  to  accept  some  other  bid  than  that  of  the  lowest  bidder,  this Company   shall   be   liable   only   for   its   proportion   of   so   much   of   the   sum   actually   expended   to   effect   repairs specified  by  the  surveyors   for  its  account  as  does  not  exceed  said  lowest  bid.  In  no  event  however  shall  this Company  respond  for  an  amount  in  excess  of  its  proportion  of  the  amount  actually  expended  by  the  assured  in effecting such repairs.

With  respect  to  physical  loss  or  damage  to  the  vessel  named  herein  this  Company  shall  be  liable  only  for such proportion of such loss or damage as the amount insured hereunder bears to the agreed valuation.

In  the  event  of  expenditure  under  the  sue  and  labor  clause,  this  Company  will  pay  the  proportion  of  such expenses  that  the  amount  insured  hereunder  bears  to  the  agreed  valuation  of  the  vessel  named  herein,  or  that  the amount insured hereunder, less loss and/or damage payable under this policy, bears to the actual value of the salved vessel, whichever proportion shall be less.

When   the   contributory   value   of   the   vessel   named   herein   is   greater   than   the   agreed   valuation   stated   herein the  liability  of  this  Company  for  general  average  contribution (except   in   respect   of   amount   made   good   to   the vessel)  or  salvage  shall  not  exceed  that  proportion  of  the  total  contribution  due  from  the  vessel  that  the  amount insured  hereunder  bears  to  the  contributory  value;  and  if  because  of  damage  for  which  this  Company  is  liable  as particular  average  the  value  of  the  vessel  has  been  reduced  for  the  purpose  of  contribution,  the  amount  of  the particular average claim under this policy shall be deducted from the amount insured hereunder and this Company shall be liable only for the proportion which such net amount bears to the contributory value.

The sum of \$	  See Declarations  Page               shall be deducted from the total amount of any or all claims 	(including claims for   sue   and  labor,   collision   liability,   general   average   and  salvage   charges)   resulting   from   any   one   accident.   This deduction  does  not  apply  to  claims  for  total  or  constructive  total  loss.  For  the  purpose  of  this  clause  each  accident shall  be  treated  separately,  but  it  is  agreed  that  a  sequence  of  damages  arising  from  the  same  accident  shall  be treated as due to that accident.

In  case  of  loss,  such  loss  to  be  paid  in  thirty  days  after  satisfactory  proof  of  loss  and  interest  shall  have been  made  and  presented  to  this  Company, (the  amount  of  any  indebtedness  due  this  Company  from  the  assured or any other party interested in this policy being first deducted). 

Upon  making  payment  under  this  policy  the  Company  shall  be  vested  with  all  of  the  assured's  rights  of  recovery against   any   person,   corporation,   vessel   or   interest   and   the   assured   shall   execute   and   deliver   instruments and papers and do whatever else is necessary to secure such rights.

Any  agreement,  contract  or  act,  past  or  future,  expressed  or  implied,  by  the  assured  whereby  any  right  of  recovery of   the   assured   against   any   vessel,   person   or   corporation   is   released,   decreased,   transferred   or   lost   which would,  on  payment  of  claim  by  this  Company,  belong  to  this  Company  but  for  such  agreement,  contract  or  act  shall render  this policy  null  and  void  as  to  the  amount  of  any  such  claim,  but  only  to  the  extent  and  to  the  amount that said  agreement,  contract  or  act  releases,  decreases,  transfers,  or  causes  the  loss  of  any  right  of  recovery  of  this Company, but the Company's right to retain or recover the full premium shall not be affected.

This  Company  shall  have  the  option  of  naming  the  attorneys  who  shall  represent  the  assured  in  the  prosecution or  defense  of  any  litigation  or  negotiations  between  the  assured  and  third  parties  concerning  any  claim,  loss  or  interest covered by this policy, and this Company shall have  the direction of such litigation or negotiations. If the assured shall  fail  or  refuse  to  settle  any  claim  as  authorized  by  the  Company,  the  liability  of  the  Company  to  the  assured shall be limited to the amount for which settlement could have been made. 

It  is  a  condition  of  this  policy  that  no  suit,  action  or  proceeding  for  the  recovery  of  any  claim  for  physical loss  of  or  damage  to  the  vessel  named  herein  shall  be  maintainable  in  any  court  of  law  or  equity  unless  the  same be  commenced  within  twelve (12)  months  next  after  the  calendar  date  of  the  happening  of  the  physical  loss  or damage  out  of  which  the  said  claim  arose.  Provided,  however,  that  if  by  the  laws  of  the  state  within  which  this policy  is  issued  such  limitation  is  invalid,  then  any  such  claim  shall  be  void  unless  such  action,  suit  or  proceeding be commenced within the shortest limit of time permitted, by the laws of such state, to be fixed herein.

In event of damage, cost of repairs to be paid without deduction of one-third, new for old. 

If claim  for total loss is admitted under this policy and sue and labor expenses have been reasonably incurred in excess  of  any  proceeds  realized  or  value  recovered,  the  amount  payable  under  this  policy  will  be  the  proportion  of such  excess  that  the  amount  insured  hereunder (without  deduction  for  loss  or  damage)  bears  to  the  agreed  valuation or the sound value of, the vessel named herein at the time of the accident, whichever value was greater.  

It  is  a  condition  of  this  insurance  that  this  Company  shall  not  be  liable  for  unrepaired  damage  in  addition to a total or constructive total loss. 

No recovery for a constructive total loss shall be had hereunder unless the expense of recovering and repairing the vessel named herein shall exceed the agreed valuation. 

In  ascertaining  whether  the  vessel  named  herein  is  a  constructive  total  loss  the  agreed  valuation  shall  be taken  as  the  repaired  value,  and  nothing  in  respect  of  the  damaged  or  break-up  value  of  the  vessel  or  wreck  shall be taken into account.

In  the  event  of  total  or  constructive  total  loss,  no  claim  to  be  made  by  this  Company  for  freight,  whether notice of abandonment has been given or not. 

Any  deviation  beyond  the  navigation  limits  provided  herein  shall  void  this  policy;  but  on  the  return  of  the vessel  in  a  seaworthy  condition,  within  the  limits  herein  provided,  this  policy  shall  reattach  and  continue  in  full force and effect, but in no case beyond the termination of this policy.

Warranted by the assured that there shall   be   no   other   insurance   covering   physical   loss   or   damage   to   the vessel  named  herein  other  than  that  which  is  provided  in  lines \ref{line:start-std-terms} through \ref{line:end-std-terms} hereof  but  permission  is granted to  carry  other  insurance  of  whatever  kind  or  nature  not  covered  by  this  policy  or  additional  amounts  of  insurance of the kind or nature covered by this policy other than as provided in lines \ref{line:start-std-terms} through \ref{line:end-std-terms}. \hl{THIS IS THE SECTION TO FIX}

This  insurance  shall  be  void  in  case  this  policy  or  the  vessel  named  herein,  shall  be  sold,  assigned,  transferred or  pledged,  or  if  there  be  any  change  of  management  or  charter  of  the  vessel,  without  the  previous  consent  in writing of this Company.

Notwithstanding   anything   to   the   contrary   contained   in   this   policy,   this  insurance   is   warranted free from \linelabel{taylor-policy} any  claim  for  loss,  damage  or  expense  caused  by  or  resulting  from  capture,  seizure,  arrest,  restraint  or  detainment,	or  the  consequences  thereof  or  of  any  attempt  thereat,  or  any  taking  of  the  vessel,  by  requisition  or  otherwise,whether  in  time  of  peace  or  war  and  whether  lawful  or  otherwise;  also  from  all  consequences  of  hostilities  or  war-like  operations (whether  there  be  a  declaration  of   war  or  not),  but  the  foregoing  shall  not  exclude  collision  or contact   with   aircraft,   rockets   or   similar   missiles,   or   with   any   fixed   or   floating   object (other   than   a   mine   or torpedo),  stranding,  heavy  weather,  fire  or  explosion  unless  caused  directly (and   independently   of   the   nature   of the  voyage  or  service  which  the  vessel  concerned  or,  in  the  case  of  a  collision,  any  other  vessel  involved  therein, is  performing)  by  a  hostile  act  by  or  against  a  belligerent  power,  and  for  the  purpose  of  this  warranty  "power" includes  any  authority  maintaining  naval,  military  or  air  forces  in  association  with  a  power;  also  warranted  free, whether  in  time  of  peace  or  war,  from  all  loss,  damage  or  expense  caused  by  any  weapon  of  war  employing  atomic or nuclear fission and/or fusion or other reaction or radioactive force or matter.

Further  warranted  free  from  the  consequences  of  civil  war,  revolution,  rebellion,  insurrection,  or  civil  strife arising therefrom, or piracy.

If  war  risks  are  hereafter  insured  by  endorsement  on  the  policy,  such  endorsement  shall  supersede  the  above warranty  only  to  the  extent  that  their  terms  are  inconsistent  and  only   while  such  war  risk   endorsement  remains in force.

Warranted   free   of   loss   or   damage   in   consequence   of   strikes,   lockouts,   political   or   labor   disturbances,   civil commotions, riots, martial law, military or usurped power or malicious acts.

Either  party  may  cancel  this  policy  by  giving  ten  days'  notice  in  writing;  if  at  the  option  of  this  Company pro rata rates, if at the request of the assured short rates, will be charged - and arrival.

        \item by making use of their merchandise or property, on the vessel described herein or elsewhere. 
        \end{enumerate}
        Such reduction shall be taken into account in arriving at the amount of loss hereunder.

        If you do not resume "operations", or do not resume "operations" as quickly as possible, we will pay based on the length of time it would have taken to resume "operations as quickly as possible."

            consideration in the settlement of the claim.  This will not increase the limit of
